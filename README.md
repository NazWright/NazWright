### 🧠 About Me  
Born in Norfolk, raised in Durham, based between Delaware & Philly — I build systems where **myth meets machine.**  

I’m an AWS-certified **Cloud Developer & Practitioner** crafting intelligent systems that live at the intersection of **AI, crypto, and design**.  
Right now, I’m building **DARIA** — the *Detection And Risk-Intelligence Agent* — a real-time fraud detection architecture that blends **AWS machine learning**, **Kinesis Data Streams**, and **Web3 transparency**.

I code like I live — with precision, movement, and expression.

> “I build apps on the cloud and stack sats on the side.” ☁️ ₿

### ⚙️ What I’m Building  
#### 🧩 [DARIA — Detection And Risk-Intelligence Agent](https://github.com/NazWright/daria)
> Real-time fraud detection system powered by **AWS Kinesis**, **SMOTE-augmented data**, and **blockchain-ready audit trails**.  
> Teaching machines not just to detect fraud — but to understand risk.

### 🪞 Philosophy  

> *"Engineering isn’t just logic — it’s choreography. Every system has rhythm, every decision has style."*

I write code like poetry and design infrastructure like sculpture.  
For me, expression and engineering are the same muscle — both are about **precision, adaptability, and flow**.
